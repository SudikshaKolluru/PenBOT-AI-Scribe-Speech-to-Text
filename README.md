# PenBOT-AI-Scribe-Speech-to-Text
PenBOT - the AI-powered scribe uses Machine Learning, Natural Language Processing and Speech Recognition to listen to the natural patient-clinician conversation, convert it into text format and create a document(containing the conversation) ready to download. AI-assisted scribes are a growing market, thanks to recent breakthroughs in AI and NLP. By parsing medically relevant and appropriate information and encapsulating it, PenBOT can go beyond verbatim summarization to map back to the appropriate fields of an EHR. As a result, PenBOT can bring the quality and experience of a human scribe.
